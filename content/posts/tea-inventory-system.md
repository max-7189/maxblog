## 5. Intelligent Prediction System

### 5.1 Basic Prediction Model: Dynamic Safety Stock Calculation

#### 5.1.1 Mathematical Principles

The basic prediction model is primarily based on **dynamic safety stock theory**, using exponential smoothing and service level concepts to optimize inventory management.

The core formula for safety stock calculation is:

$$SS = z \cdot \sigma_L \cdot \sqrt{L}$$

Where:
- $SS$ is the safety stock level
- $z$ is the Z-score corresponding to the service level in standard normal distribution
- $\sigma_L$ is the standard deviation of demand
- $L$ is the lead time for restocking

In the system implementation, it is expressed as:

$$SS = \overline{D} \cdot L + z \cdot \sigma_D \cdot \sqrt{L}$$

Where:
- $\overline{D}$ is the daily average consumption
- $\sigma_D$ is the standard deviation of consumption

#### 5.1.2 Service Level and Z-Score Relationship

Service levels and Z-scores are related through the standard normal distribution function:

| Service Level | Z-Score |
|--------------|---------|
| 90%          | 1.28    |
| 95%          | 1.65    |
| 98%          | 2.33    |
| 99%          | 2.58    |

#### 5.1.3 Exponential Smoothing

Exponential smoothing is used to predict future consumption, calculated as:

$$F_t = \alpha \cdot D_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot F_{t-1}$$

Where:
- $F_t$ is the forecast for time t
- $D_{t-1}$ is the actual consumption at time t-1
- $F_{t-1}$ is the forecast for time t-1
- $\alpha$ is the smoothing coefficient (0.1-0.5)

### 5.1.4 Code Implementation

```swift
func calculateDynamicSafetyStock(ingredient: Ingredient, alpha: Double? = nil, serviceLevel: Double? = nil) -> Double {
    // If prediction feature is turned off, return a percentage of initial stock as safety stock
    if !enablePrediction {
        return ingredient.initialStock * 0.2
    }
    
    let serviceLevelValue = serviceLevel ?? self.serviceLevel
    
    let dailyConsumptionAverage = calculateDailyConsumptionAverage(ingredient: ingredient)
    let standardDeviation = calculateConsumptionStandardDeviation(ingredient: ingredient)
    let leadTime = Double(ingredient.leadTime)
    
    // Service level coefficient (Z)
    let zScore = calculateZScore(serviceLevel: serviceLevelValue)
    
    return dailyConsumptionAverage * leadTime + zScore * standardDeviation * sqrt(leadTime)
}

// Z-score calculation
private func calculateZScore(serviceLevel: Double) -> Double {
    switch serviceLevel {
    case 0.90...0.91: return 1.28
    case 0.92...0.93: return 1.41
    case 0.94...0.95: return 1.65
    case 0.96...0.97: return 1.88
    case 0.98...0.99: return 2.33
    case 0.9985...0.9999: return 3.0
    default: return 1.65
    }
}

// Standard deviation calculation
private func calculateStandardDeviation(values: [Double]) -> Double {
    guard !values.isEmpty else { return 0.0 }
    
    let count = Double(values.count)
    let mean = values.reduce(0.0, +) / count
    let sumOfSquaredDifferences = values.map { pow($0 - mean, 2) }.reduce(0.0, +)
    
    return sqrt(sumOfSquaredDifferences / count)
}
```

### 5.1.5 Reorder Point and Restock Quantity Calculation

The system determines whether restocking is needed based on current inventory and safety stock:

$$RestockQuantity = (DailyConsumptionAverage \times LeadTime + SafetyStock) - CurrentStock$$

This is implemented in code as:

```swift
func calculateSuggestedRestockAmount(ingredient: Ingredient) -> Double {
    let remainingStock = calculateRemainingStock(ingredient: ingredient)
    
    if enablePrediction {
        let dailyConsumptionAverage = calculateDailyConsumptionAverage(ingredient: ingredient)
        let leadTime = Double(ingredient.leadTime)
        
        // Calculate expected consumption during lead time
        let expectedConsumptionDuringLeadTime = dailyConsumptionAverage * leadTime
        
        // Calculate safety stock
        let safetyStock = calculateDynamicSafetyStock(ingredient: ingredient)
        
        // Suggested restock amount = Expected consumption during lead time + Safety stock - Current stock
        let suggestedAmount = expectedConsumptionDuringLeadTime + safetyStock - remainingStock
        
        return max(0, suggestedAmount)
    } else {
        return max(0, ingredient.initialStock - remainingStock)
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Regression Analysis Model: Ingredient Consumption Prediction

#### 5.2.1 Mathematical Principles

The regression analysis model uses **multivariate linear regression** techniques to establish the relationship between product sales and ingredient consumption. The core is solving the matrix equation:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{\epsilon}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{y}$ is the ingredient consumption vector
- $\mathbf{X}$ is the product sales matrix
- $\mathbf{\beta}$ is the regression coefficient vector (to be determined)
- $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is the error term

The system implements linear regression with L2 regularization (Ridge regression), with the objective function:

$$J(\mathbf{\beta}) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\mathbf{\beta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\beta_j^2$$

Where:
- $m$ is the number of samples
- $n$ is the number of features (product types)
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter
- $h_{\mathbf{\beta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ is the prediction function, equal to $\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \cdot \mathbf{\beta}$

#### 5.2.2 Hybrid Prediction System

The final prediction uses a hybrid system, combining recipe calculation and regression prediction:

$$Consumption = \alpha \times RecipeCalculatedValue + (1-\alpha) \times RegressionPredictedValue$$

Where $\alpha$ is adjusted with model maturity:

$$\alpha = 1 - ModelMaturity$$

#### 5.2.3 Gradient Descent Training

```swift
// Train model using gradient descent algorithm
private func trainWithGradientDescent(X: [[Double]], y: [Double], iterations: Int = 1000, learningRate: Double = 0.01, l2Regularization: Double = 0.1) -> [Double] {
    let m = Double(X.count)  // Number of samples
    let n = X[0].count       // Number of features
    
    // Initialize parameters
    var theta = Array(repeating: 0.0, n)
    
    // Execute gradient descent
    for _ in 0..<iterations {
        // Calculate predictions
        let predictions = X.map { row in
            dotProduct(row, theta)
        }
        
        // Calculate errors
        let errors = zip(predictions, y).map { $0 - $1 }
        
        // Update parameters (with L2 regularization)
        for j in 0..<n {
            let gradient = (1.0/m) * (
                zip(errors, X).map { error, row in
                    error * row[j]
                }.reduce(0, +) +
                l2Regularization * theta[j]  // L2 regularization term
            )
            
            theta[j] = theta[j] - learningRate * gradient
        }
    }
    
    return theta
}

// Calculate dot product
private func dotProduct(_ row: [Double], _ theta: [Double]) -> Double {
    return zip(row, theta).reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1.0 * $1.1 }
}
```

#### 5.2.4 Feature Normalization

```swift
// Normalize features
private func normalizeFeatures(X: [[Double]]) -> ([[Double]], [Double], [Double]) {
    let n = X[0].count
    var means = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: n)
    var stdDevs = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: n)
    
    // Calculate mean for each column
    for j in 0..<n {
        let column = X.map { $0[j] }
        means[j] = column.reduce(0.0, +) / Double(column.count)
    }
    
    // Calculate standard deviation for each column
    for j in 0..<n {
        let column = X.map { $0[j] }
        let squaredDiffs = column.map { pow($0 - means[j], 2) }
        stdDevs[j] = sqrt(squaredDiffs.reduce(0.0, +) / Double(column.count))
        // Prevent division by zero
        if stdDevs[j] == 0 {
            stdDevs[j] = 1.0
        }
    }
    
    // Normalize data
    let normalizedX = X.map { row in
        (0..<n).map { j in
            (row[j] - means[j]) / stdDevs[j]
        }
    }
    
    return (normalizedX, means, stdDevs)
}
```

#### 5.2.5 Hybrid Prediction Implementation

```swift
// Predict consumption
func predictConsumption(ingredientID: String, sales: [String: Double], recipeBasedConsumption: Double) -> Double {
    // Get hybrid coefficient
    let alpha = RegressionModelStore.shared.getModelAlpha()
    
    // Recipe-based calculation
    let recipeAmount = recipeBasedConsumption
    
    // If no trained model or empty sales data, return recipe-based calculation
    guard let model = models[ingredientID], !sales.isEmpty else {
        return recipeAmount
    }
    
    // Prepare feature vector
    var features: [Double] = []
    for productID in model.productIDs {
        features.append(sales[productID] ?? 0.0)
    }
    
    // Feature normalization
    let normalizedFeatures = features.enumerated().map { j, value in
        (value - model.means[j]) / model.stdDevs[j]
    }
    
    // Calculate prediction
    let prediction = dotProduct(normalizedFeatures, model.coefficients)
    
    // Use hybrid model
    return alpha * recipeAmount + (1 - alpha) * prediction
}
```

#### 5.2.6 Model Maturity Calculation

Model maturity is calculated based on the number of training samples collected and prediction accuracy:

```swift
func getRegressionModelMaturity() -> Double {
    // Sample ratio, maximum 1.0
    let sampleRatio = min(Double(collectedDataPoints) / Double(requiredDataPointsForMaturity), 1.0)
    
    // MSE change ratio, maximum 1.0
    let mseRatio = baselineMSE > 0 ? min(1.0 - (currentMSE / baselineMSE), 1.0) : 0.0
    
    // Combined score, sample size has 70% weight, error improvement has 30% weight
    let maturity = 0.7 * sampleRatio + 0.3 * mseRatio
    
    return max(0.0, min(maturity, 1.0))
}
```

#### 5.2.7 Regression Model Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow of the regression model in the TeaInventory system:

```

The model workflow includes data collection, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model deployment, and continuous updates. During the prediction phase, the system combines regression predictions with recipe calculations to generate the final consumption forecasts, providing accurate restock suggestions.

#### 5.2.8 Model Performance Visualization

Through visualization of the regression model's test data, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the model's performance.

##### R² Values vs Sample Size

    }
  ]
}
{{< /echarts >}}

With a sample size of approximately 40-50 data points, most ingredients' R² values stabilize above 0.9, indicating that the model has achieved good predictive performance.

##### Actual vs Predicted Values

      "lineStyle": {
        "type": "dotted"
      }
    }
  ]
}
{{< /echarts >}}

From the chart, it's evident that as the model learns, regression predictions increasingly approach actual consumption values, and in some cases perform better than recipe calculations alone.

            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
{{< /echarts >}}

The error distribution shows that approximately 73% of prediction errors fall within the ±5% range, demonstrating the model's good prediction accuracy.

The correlation matrix reveals consumption pattern relationships between different ingredients, which is valuable for understanding product recipes and optimizing inventory management.

Through these visualizations, we can clearly see the effectiveness of the regression model in predicting ingredient consumption and how it continuously improves accuracy as data accumulates. These data-driven insights provide a solid technical foundation for the intelligent inventory management of the TeaInventory system.

### 5.3 Model Integration and Adaptive Mechanisms

The Tea system integrates the two models and implements adaptive optimization through the following mechanisms:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting actual consumption data through inventory count differences and sales records

2. **Model Training Triggers**:
   - Early versions: New data automatically triggers training
   - Current version: Manual confirmation of training to ensure high-quality data

3. **Adaptive Adjustment of Hybrid Coefficients**:
   - As model maturity increases, α value automatically decreases
   - Users can manually adjust to accommodate recipe changes

4. **Prediction Evaluation**:
   - Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance
   - Normalized scoring by comparison with benchmark models

This integrated design combines classical inventory theory with machine learning methods to achieve efficient and accurate inventory prediction and management, particularly suitable for beverage shops with complex recipes and variable consumption patterns.
