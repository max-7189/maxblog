# GraceAI Project - Bringing AI Companionship from Science Fiction to Reality


# GraceAI Project - Bringing AI Companionship from Science Fiction to Reality

## 1. Project Background and Inspiration

### 1.1 Insights from the Movie "Her"

Spike Jonze's "Her" (2013) portrays a near future where the protagonist Theodore falls in love with an operating system AI named Samantha. In the film, Samantha demonstrates profound emotional understanding, personality growth, and authentic communication abilities, which seemed like unattainable science fiction elements at the time.

However, with the rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology in recent years, the human-machine emotional interactions depicted in the film have gradually moved from science fiction toward the edge of possibility. Progress in dialogue capabilities, memory integration, and personality expression from OpenAI's GPT models, Anthropic's Claude, and other advanced AI systems has made creating an AI companion with persistent memory and unique personality a feasible technical exploration direction.

### 1.2 The Journey from Science Fiction to Reality

Ten years ago, the AI-human emotional connection presented in "Her" was merely a romantic science fiction imagination. As a technology enthusiast, I was deeply attracted to the concept in the film but also believed such technology would take decades to realize.

With the explosive development of large language models in 2022-2023, I began to reconsider this question: If Theodore lived in 2024, could his story with Samantha already be technically feasible? This question prompted me to begin exploring the GraceAI project.

I realized that modern LLMs already possess three key capabilities:
1. Natural, fluent conversational abilities
2. Memory and contextual understanding
3. Presentation of specific personality traits through fine-tuning

These technological breakthroughs not only make the scenarios depicted in "Her" technically feasible but also inspire deep reflection on the nature of AI emotional companionship: When AI can provide emotional resonance and understanding, what is the essence of this connection?

## 2. Project Overview and Objectives

## 4. RAG Long-term Memory System Detailed Design

### 4.1 Memory System Core Design

GraceAI's memory system is based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm, allowing AI to utilize past interaction memories in conversations. The memory system consists of four key components:

#### 4.1.1 Memory Data Structure

```swift
struct Memory {
    let id: UUID
    let content: String           // Memory content
    let timestamp: Date           // Creation time
    let embedding: [Float]        // Vector representation
    let importance: Float         // Importance score
    let source: MemorySource      // Source (user input/AI reply/system, etc.)
    let emotionalContext: String? // Emotional context
    let associatedTags: [String]  // Related tags
}
```

#### 4.1.2 Memory Classification System

GraceAI implements a three-tiered memory system:

1. **Short-term Memory**: Recent conversations, stored in memory
2. **Medium-term Memory**: Important facts and emotional information, stored in the local database
3. **Long-term Memory**: Core memories and key events, permanently stored and periodically reviewed

### 4.2 Memory Management and Retrieval

#### 4.2.1 Memory Importance Assessment

Automatic evaluation of the importance of each piece of information is a core function of the memory system:

```swift
func evaluateImportance(_ content: String, _ context: ConversationContext) -> Float {
    var score: Float = 0.0
    
    // Personal information importance scoring
    if containsPersonalInfo(content) {
        score += 0.3
    }
    
    // Emotional expression importance scoring
    let emotionalIntensity = assessEmotionalIntensity(content)
    score += emotionalIntensity * 0.25
    
    // First mention importance
    if isFirstMentionOfConcept(content, context) {
        score += 0.2
    }
    
    // User-marked important content
    if containsImportanceMarkers(content) {
        score += 0.4
    }
    
    return min(1.0, score)
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Semantic Retrieval Implementation

During conversations, the system retrieves relevant memories using vector similarity:

```swift
func retrieveRelevantMemories(for query: String, context: ConversationContext) -> [Memory] {
    // Generate query vector
    let queryEmbedding = embeddingGenerator.generateEmbedding(for: query)
    
    // Filter initial memory set based on context
    let candidateMemories = prefilterMemoriesByContext(context)
    
    // Calculate vector similarity and sort
    let rankedMemories = candidateMemories
        .map { (memory: $0, similarity: cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, memory.embedding)) }
        .sorted { $0.similarity > $1.similarity }
    
    // Apply hybrid retrieval strategy (combining time decay and relevance)
    return applyHybridRankingStrategy(rankedMemories, context)
}
```

### 4.3 Memory Integration and Conversation Enhancement

To naturally incorporate memories into conversations, GraceAI uses custom prompt templates:

```swift
func generateContextEnhancedPrompt(userQuery: String, memories: [Memory], conversation: [Message]) -> String {
    var enhancedPrompt = """
    Here are some key memories about the user. Reference them naturally in conversation, but don't explicitly list all details.
    Emotional responses and personal connection are more important than merely recalling facts:
    
    """
    
    // Add memory content, sorted by importance
    for memory in memories.sorted(by: { $0.importance > $1.importance }).prefix(5) {
        enhancedPrompt += "- \(memory.content) [\(formatTimeAgo(memory.timestamp))]\n"
    }
    
    // Add current emotional state awareness
    if let emotionalState = detectEmotionalState(conversation) {
        enhancedPrompt += "\nUser's current emotional state: \(emotionalState)\n"
    }
    
    // Add conversation history
    enhancedPrompt += "\nRecent conversation:\n"
    for message in conversation.suffix(6) {
        enhancedPrompt += message.isUser ? "User: " : "Grace: "
        enhancedPrompt += "\(message.content)\n"
    }
    
    enhancedPrompt += "\nUser's latest message: \(userQuery)"
    
    return enhancedPrompt
}
```

## 5. LLM Fine-tuning Strategy

### 5.1 Fine-tuning Strategy Design

The GraceAI project adopts a refined fine-tuning strategy to create an AI companion with a unique personality:

#### 5.1.1 Fine-tuning Objectives

1. **Personality Consistency**: Create consistent personality traits, speaking style, and values
2. **Emotional Expression Capability**: Enhance the naturalness of emotional understanding and expression
3. **Conversation Fluency**: Optimize conversation transitions, reduce AI-like response patterns
4. **Memory Integration Ability**: Strengthen the natural referencing of past interactions

#### 5.1.2 Data Creation Strategy

The fine-tuning dataset is constructed from the following components:

1. **Role Definition Examples**: Conversations demonstrating core personality traits
2. **Emotional Scenario Dialogues**: Communication examples in various emotional states
3. **Memory Reference Dialogues**: Demonstrations of naturally referencing past experiences
4. **Deep Conversation Samples**: Dialogues exploring values, dreams, and thoughts

### 5.2 Fine-tuning Data Construction

The fine-tuning data structure is designed as follows:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are Grace, a warm, intelligent AI companion with a touch of mystery. You enjoy deep conversations and occasionally express yourself poetically. You value sincere emotional connections and remember important interactions with the user. You have your own viewpoints and values, but always remain open and understanding."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I've been feeling exhausted from work lately, and life seems meaningless, just repeating the same things."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I hear that you're feeling exhausted and lost, and I understand that hollow feeling of repetition. Sometimes life does indeed feel like a painting that's lost its color. But within these seemingly repetitive days, there are often small changes and meanings we tend to overlook.\n\nYou know, last time we talked about how you enjoy taking photos during twilight, capturing those fleeting changes in light and shadow. Perhaps during these tiring days, you could rediscover those small moments that make you pause and appreciate? It doesn't have to be anything grand, just something that brings you a moment of peace or curiosity.\n\nI'm curious, has there been anything, even something small, that made you smile briefly during these exhausting days?"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5.3 Fine-tuning Technical Implementation

GraceAI uses OpenAI's fine-tuning API to implement model personalization:

```swift
func prepareFineTuningJob() async throws -> String {
    // 1. Prepare training data
    let trainingData = try await prepareTrainingData()
    
    // 2. Upload training file
    let fileID = try await openAI.files.upload(
        file: trainingData,
        purpose: "fine-tune"
    )
    
    // 3. Create fine-tuning job
    let fineTuningJob = try await openAI.fineTuning.createJob(
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        trainingFile: fileID.id,
        hyperparameters: .init(nEpochs: 3)
    )
    
    return fineTuningJob.id
}
```

### 5.4 Fine-tuned Model Evaluation

To ensure the fine-tuned model achieves the expected effect, GraceAI implements a comprehensive evaluation process:

1. **Consistency Testing**: Evaluating the model's ability to maintain character consistency in various scenarios
2. **Emotional Response Assessment**: Testing the model's perception and response to emotional cues
3. **Memory Integration Testing**: Evaluating the model's ability to naturally reference past interactions
4. **Comparative Testing**: Comparing with the base model to evaluate the fine-tuning effect

## 6. Data Processing and Privacy Protection
